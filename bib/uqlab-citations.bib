  abstract = {The wind energy industry is continuously researching better computational models of wind inflow and turbulence to predict extreme loading (the nature of randomness) and their corresponding probability of occurrence. Sophisticated load alleviation control systems are increasingly being designed and deployed to specifically reduce the adverse effects of extreme load events resulting in lighter structures. The main objective herein is to show that despite large uncertainty in the extreme turbulence models, advanced load alleviation control systems yield both a reduction in magnitude and scatter of the extreme loads which in turn translates in a change in the shape of the annual maximum load distribution function resulting in improved structural reliability. Using a probabilistic loads extrapolation approach and the first order reliability method, a large multi-megawatt wind turbine blade and tower structural reliability are assessed when the extreme turbulence model is uncertain. The structural reliability is assessed for the wind turbine when three configurations of an industrial grade load alleviation control system of increasing complexity and performance are used. The load alleviation features include a cyclic pitch, individual pitch, static thrust limiter, condition based thrust limiter and an active tower vibration damper. We show that large uncertainties in the extreme turbulence model can be mitigated and significantly reduced while maintaining an acceptable structural reliability level when advanced load alleviation control systems are used. We end by providing a rational comparison between the long term loads extrapolation method and the environmental contour method for the three control configurations.},

  abstract     = {Over the last years, a lot of effort has been made to make existing uncertainty quantification techniques more efficient in high dimensions. An important class of methods relies on the assumption that the polynomial chaos representation of the model response is sparse. This paper contributes to the validation and assessment of an innovative basis selection technique for building sparse polynomial chaos expansions. A regression approach is used for computing the polynomial chaos coefficients. The technique is based on statistical inference theory which provides information about the true regression model from an estimated regression model based on samples. The latter information is used to build iteratively the sparse polynomial chaos expansion. Using the developed methodology, a more robust and efficient basis selection technique is obtained. For validation purpose, the methodology is applied to high dimensional analytical test cases, including the Oakley & O'Hagan function (d=15) and the Morris function (d=20). The results are compared with those obtained from two state-of-the-art techniques, namely the LARS-based algorithm and compressive sampling. As compared to previous work, more comparisons with the LARS-based method are provided, through the use of UQLab, a MATLAB-based uncertainty quantification framework developed by Sudret and Marelli [1]. It is shown that, with equal settings, the developed methodology results in a more accurate polynomial chaos expansion compared to the aforementioned technique. In addition, a new criterion for building an optimal polynomial chaos expansion is further investigated. The conclusions are in-line with previous findings, i.e. the present criterion always builds a sparser polynomial chaos expansion which is, in addition, at least as accurate as compared to the optimal polynomial chaos expansion obtained from the classical cross validation technique.},

  abstract = {Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansions are widely used in various engineering fields for quantifying uncertainties arising from uncertain parameters. The computational cost of classical PC solution schemes is unaffordable as the number of deterministic simulations to be calculated grows dramatically with the number of stochastic dimension. This considerably restricts the practical use of PC at the industrial level. A common approach to address such problems is to make use of sparse PC expansions. This paper presents a non-intrusive regression-based method for building sparse PC expansions. The most important PC contributions are detected sequentially through an automatic search procedure. The variable selection criterion is based on efficient tools relevant to probabilistic method. Two benchmark analytical functions are used to validate the proposed algorithm. The computational efficiency of the method is then illustrated by a more realistic CFD application, consisting of the non-deterministic flow around a transonic airfoil subject to geometrical uncertainties. To assess the performance of the developed methodology, a detailed comparison is made with the well established LAR-based selection technique. The results show that the developed sparse regression technique is able to identify the most significant PC contributions describing the problem. Moreover, the most important stochastic features are captured at a reduced computational cost compared to the LAR method. The results also demonstrate the superior robustness of the method by repeating the analyses using random experimental designs.},

  abstract     = {We present an optimal sensor placement methodology for structural health monitoring (SHM) purposes, relying on a Bayesian experimental design approach. The unknown structural properties, e.g. the residual strength and stiffness, are inferred from data collected through a network of sensors, whose architecture, i.e., type and position may largely affect the accuracy of the monitoring system. In tackling this issue, an optimal network configuration is herein sought by maximizing the expected information gain between prior and posterior probability distributions of the parameters to be estimated. Since the objective function linked to the network topology cannot be analytically computed, a numerical approximation is provided by means of a Monte Carlo analysis, wherein each realization is obtained via finite element modeling. Since the computational burden linked to this procedure often grows infeasible, a Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) approach is adopted for accelerating the computation of the forward problem. The analysis expands over joint samples covering both structural state and design variables, i.e., sensor locations. Via increase of the number of deployed sensors in the network, the optimization procedure soon turns computationally costly due to the curse of dimensionality. To this end, a stochastic optimization method is adopted for accelerating the convergence of the optimization process and thereby the damage detection capability of the SHM system. The proposed method is applied to thin flexible structures, and the resulting optimal sensor configuration is shown. The effects of the number of training samples, the polynomial degree of the approximation expansion and the optimization settings are also discussed.},

Quantification of the effect of these uncertainties would enable researchers to estimate the variances of structural responses observed from experiments. This poses challenges for real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) due to the existence of actuator delay. Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) projects the model outputs on a basis of orthogonal stochastic polynomials to account for influences of model uncertainties. In this paper, PCE is utilized to evaluate effect of actuator delay on the maximum displacement from real-time hybrid simulation of a single degree of freedom (SDOF) structure when accounting for uncertainties in structural properties. The PCE is first applied for RTHS without delay to determine the order of PCE, the number of sample points as well as the method for coefficients calculation. The PCE is then applied to RTHS with actuator delay. The mean, variance and Sobol indices are compared and discussed to evaluate the effects of actuator delay on uncertainty quantification for RTHS. Results show that the mean and the variance of the maximum displacement increase linearly and exponentially with respect to actuator delay, respectively. Sensitivity analysis through Sobol indices also indicates the influence of the single random variable decreases while the coupling effect increases with the increase of actuator delay.},

  abstract = {Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is widely used by engineers and modelers in various engineering fields for uncertainty analysis. The computational cost of full PCE is unaffordable for the "curse of dimensionality" of the expansion coefficients. In this paper, a new method for developing sparse PCE is proposed based on the diffeomorphic modulation under observable response preserving homotopy (D-MORPH) algorithm. D-MORPH is a regression technique, it can construct the full PCE models with model evaluations much less than the unknown coefficients. This technique determines the unknown coefficients by minimizing the least-squared error and an objective function. For the purpose of developing sparse PCE, an iterative reweighted algorithm is proposed to construct the objective function. As a result, the objective in D-MORPH regression is converted to minimize the â1 norm of PCE coefficients, and the sparse PCE is established after the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal value. To validate the performance of the developed methodology, several benchmark examples are investigated. The accuracy and efficiency are compared to the well-established least angle regression (LAR) sparse PCE, and results show that the developed method is superior to the LAR-based sparse PCE in terms of efficiency and accuracy.},

  abstract = {The cost of offshore wind turbine substructures has a significant impact on competitiveness of the wind energy market and is affected by conservative safety margins adopted in the design phase. This implies that an accurate design load prediction, especially of those resulting in fatigue damage accumulation, may help achieve more cost-effective solutions. In this article, the impact of turbulence and wave loads on fatigue reliability of pile foundations is investigated for a 5-MW offshore wind turbine. Loads obtained by varying turbulence percentiles are compared with those obtained from the full joint probability distribution of wind speed and turbulence through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and from the equivalent turbulence level currently adopted by IEC standards. The analyses demonstrate that a lower equivalent turbulence percentile leads to a more realistic and less conservative estimation of fatigue loads. Subsequently, the research focuses on studying the effects of uncertain marine environments on the fatigue load distribution, showing that the latter is insensitive to the random variability of the hydrodynamic coefficients. With respect to the wave kinematic model, a comparison between nonlinear and linear waves clearly suggests that hydrodynamic forces depend significantly on the kinematic model adopted and the operational conditions of the turbine. Furthermore, a term is derived to correct the error introduced by Wheeler stretching at finite water depths. The respective model uncertainties that originate from the nonlinear irregular wave model and Wheeler correction are quantified and employed in a reliability analysis. In a case study, the results are finally compared in terms of estimated probability of failure, with the aim to quantify the influence of environmental models on monopile reliability.},

A stable TMS under uncertain wind loads (without any tearing failure) can only be achieved by a proper choice of the initial prestress. In this work, a double-loop reliability-based design optimisation (RBDO) of TMS under uncertain wind load is proposed. Using a sequential polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and kriging based metamodel, this RBDO reduces the cost of inner-loop reliability analysis involving an intensive finite element solver. The proposed general approach is applied to the RBDO of two benchmark TMS and its computational efficiency is demonstrated through these case studies.

Indeed, with its polarimetric and interferometric capabilities, the TanDEM-X mission enables the tracking of crop height through interferometric SAR (InSAR), polarimetric interferometric SAR (PolInSAR) and the inversion of radiative transfer-based backscattering model. The paper evaluates the three aforementioned techniques simultaneously with a data set acquired in September 2014 and 2015 over rice fields in Turkey during their reproductive stage. The assessment of the absolute height accuracy and the limitations of the approaches are provided. In-situ measurements conducted in the same cultivation periods are used for validation purposes. The PolInSAR and morphological backscattering model results showed better performance with low RMSEs (12 and 13 cm) compared to the differential InSAR result having RMSE of 18 cm. The spatial baseline, i.e. the distance between satellites, is a key parameter for coherent methods such as InSAR and PolInSAR. Its effect on the absolute height accuracy is discussed using TanDEM-X pairs separated by a baseline of 101.7m and 932m. Although the InSAR based approach is demonstrated to provide sufficient crop height accuracy, the availability of a precise vegetation-free digital elevation model and a structurally dense crop are basic requirements for achieving high accuracy. The PolInSAR approach provides reliable crop height estimation if the spatial baseline is large enough for the inversion. The impact of increasing spatial baseline on the absolute accuracy of the crop height estimation is evident for both methods. However, PolInSAR is more cost-efficient, e.g. there is no need for phase unwrapping and any external vegetation free surface elevation data. Instead, the usage of radiative transfer based backscattering models provides not only crop height but also other biophysical properties of the crops with consistent accuracy. The efficient retrieval of crop height with backscattering model is achieved by metamodelling, which makes the computational cost of backscattering inversion comparable to the ones of the coherent methods. However, effectiveness depends on not only the backscattering model, but also the integration of agronomic crop growth rules. Motivated by these results, a combination of backscattering and PolInSAR inversion models would provide a successful method of future precision farming studies.},

To apply means of shape optimization, suitable variables need to be chosen to formulate the objective function, which is here the volume of the arch dam. A genetic algorithm is adopted as the optimization method, which allows a global search. The reliability index is considered as the main constraint. Its computation is realized by adaptive Kriging Monte Carlo simulation, which visibly increases the analysis efficiency compared with traditional Monte Carlo simulations. Constraints, such as the reliability index and further with respect to the geometry, are taken into consideration by a penalty formulation. By means of this approach, a reliability-based design can be found which ensures both the safety and serviceability of a newly designed arch-type dam.},

  abstract = {The process of reservoir history-matching is a costly task. Many available history-matching algorithms either fail to perform such a task or they require a large number of simulation runs. To overcome such struggles, we apply the Gaussian Process (GP) modeling technique to approximate the costly objective functions and to expedite finding the global optima. A GP model is a proxy, which is employed to model the input-output relationships by assuming a multi-Gaussian distribution on the output values. An infill criterion is used in conjunction with a GP model to help sequentially add the samples with potentially lower outputs. The IC fault model is used to compare the efficiency of GP-based optimization method with other typical optimization methods for minimizing the objective function. In this paper, we present the applicability of using a GP modeling approach for reservoir history-matching problems, which is exemplified by numerical analysis of production data from a horizontal multi-stage fractured tight gas condensate well. The results for the case that is studied here show a quick convergence to the lowest objective values in less than 100 simulations for this 20-dimensional problem. This amounts to an almost 10 times faster performance compared to the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm that is also known to be a powerful optimization technique. The sensitivities are conducted to explain the performance of the GP-based optimization technique with various correlation functions.},

Thus, the use of probabilistic approach is usually recommended which is problematic due to high computational demand. This paper presents a simplified reliability analysis framework for gravity dams subjected to flooding, earthquakes, and aging. A group of time-variant degradation models are proposed for different random variables. Response of the dam is presented by explicit limit state functions. The probability of failure is directly computed by either classical Monte Carlo simulation or the refined importance sampling technique. Next, three machine learning techniques (i.e., K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and naive Bayes classifier) are adopted for binary classification of the structural results. These methods are then demonstrated in terms of accuracy, applicability and computational time for prediction of the failure probability. Results are then generalized for different dam classes (based on the height-to-width ratio), various water levels, earthquake intensity, degradation rate, and cross-correlation between the random variables. Finally, a sigmoid-type function is proposed for analytical calculation of the failure probability for different classes of gravity dams. This function is then specialized for the hydrological hazard and the failure surface is presented as a direct function of the dam's height and width.},

In particular, the time required to perform a benchmarking study can quickly spiral out of control, owing to the number of distinct variables to systematically examine. In this paper, we propose IRIS, an IteRative and Intelligent Experiment Selection methodology, to maximize the information gain while minimizing the duration of the benchmarking process. IRIS selects the region to place the next experiment point based on the variability of both dependent, i.e., response, and independent variables in that region. It aims to identify a performance function that minimizes the response variable prediction error for a constant and limited experimentation budget. We evaluate IRIS for a wide selection of experimental, simulated and synthetic systems with one, two and three independent variables. Considering a limited experimentation budget, the results show IRIS is able to reduce the performance function prediction error up to 4:3 times compared to equal distance experiment point selection. Moreover, we show that the error reduction can further improve through system-specific parameter tuning. Analysis of the error distributions obtained with IRIS reveals that the technique is particularly effective in regions where the response variable is sensitive to changes in the independent variables.},

  abstract     = {Computational modeling of the structural behavior of continuous fiber composite materials often takes into account the periodicity of the underlying micro-structure. A well established method dealing with the structural behavior of periodic micro-structures is the socalled Asymptotic Expansion Homogenization (AEH). By considering a periodic perturbation of the material displacement, scale bridging functions, also referred to as elastic correctors, can be derived in order to connect the strains at the level of the macro-structure with microstructural strains. For complicated inhomogeneous micro-structures, the derivation of such functions is usually performed by the numerical solution of a PDE problem -Typically with the Finite Element Method. Moreover, when dealing with uncertain micro-structural geometry and material parameters, there is considerable uncertainty introduced in the actual stresses experienced by the materials. Due to the high computational cost of computing the elastic correctors, the choice of a pure Monte-Carlo approach for dealing with the inevitable material and geometric uncertainties is clearly computationally intractable. This problem is even more pronounced when the effect of damage in the micro-scale is considered, where re-evaluation of the micro-structural representative volume element is necessary for every occurring damage. The novelty in this paper is that a non-intrusive surrogate modeling approach is employed with the purpose of directly bridging the macro-scale behavior of the structure with the material behavior in the micro-scale, therefore reducing the number of costly evaluations of corrector functions, allowing for future developments on the incorporation of fatigue or static damage in the analysis of composite structural components.},

Wind turbine blades are subjected throughout their lifetime to highly stochastic loading.

A simple fatigue accumulation model is utilized for the spar cap reinforcement of a wind-turbine blade. Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for the damage accumulation random field is used for dimensionality reduction.

The proposed method takes advantage of three state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methodologies reasonably: the hyperbolic scheme to truncate the infinite polynomial chaos (PC) series; the least angle regression (LARS) technique to select the optimal degree of each univariate PC series; and the Copula to deal with nonlinear correlations among random input variables. Consequently, the proposed method brings appealing features to PPF, including the ability to handle the large-scale uncertainty sources; to tackle the nonlinear correlation among the random inputs; to analytically calculate representative statistics of the desired outputs; and to dramatically alleviate the computational burden as of traditional methods. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are verified through either quantitative indicators or graphical results of PPF on both the IEEE European Low Voltage Test Feeder and the IEEE 123 Node Test Feeder, in the presence of more than 100 correlated uncertain input variables.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the impact of uncertain inputs is valuable, especially in power systems with large amounts of stochastic renewable generations. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) can determine the impact of input uncertainties on the output quantity of interest in a certain physical or mathematical model. The GSA has not been widely employed in power systems due to the prohibitively computational burden. In this paper, it is demonstrated that, via the implementation of a basis-Adaptive sparse polynomial chaos expansion, a GSA can be applied to the power system with numerous uncertain inputs. The performance of the proposed method is tested on both the IEEE 13-bus test feeder and the IEEE 123-node test system, in presence of a large amount of independent or correlated uncertain inputs. The possible application of a GSA on the basis of the basis-Adaptive sparse polynomial chaos expansion in power systems are discussed in terms of various sensitivities. The findings cannot only be used to rank the most influential input uncertainties with respect to a specific output, such as variances of the nodal power, but also to identify the most sensitive or robust electrical variables such as the bus voltage with respect to input uncertainties.},

PCK is a form of universal Kriging (UK) that employs orthogonal polynomials and least-angle-regression (LARS) algorithm to select the proper set of polynomial basis. The use of LARS within the PCK algorithm eliminates the need for the manual selection of UK's trend function. Investigation on the capability of PCK-EGO is performed on five synthetic and one aerodynamic test problems. In light of the results, we observe that PCK-EGO performs in a similar way to standard EGO in cases with no clear polynomial-like trend. However, PCK-EGO shows a notable faster convergence in problems where the objective function exhibits a landscape trend that can be captured by polynomials. Application to the subsonic wing problem further demonstrates that PCK-EGO is more efficient than EGO in a real-world aerodynamic optimization problem.},

While several robust optimization approaches have been presented to address this issue, appropriate methods to accurately estimate the robustness of treatment plans are still lacking. To fill this gap we present Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) techniques which are easily applicable and create a meta-model of the dose engine by approximating the dose in every voxel with multidimensional polynomials. This Polynomial Chaos (PC) model can be built in an automated fashion relatively cheaply and subsequently it can be used to perform comprehensive robustness analysis. We adapted PC to provide among others the expected dose, the dose variance, accurate probability distribution of dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics (e.g. minimum tumor or maximum organ dose), exact bandwidths of DVHs, and to separate the effects of random and systematic errors. We present the outcome of our verification experiments based on 6 head-and-neck (HN) patients, and exemplify the usefulness of PCE by comparing a robust and a non-robust treatment plan for a selected HN case. The results suggest that PCE is highly valuable for both research and clinical applications.},

The Life Quality Index (LQI) acceptance criterion is a societal indicator that is used to judge the efficiency of safety measures to reduce the risk to life and can be used to optimise the investments into life saving measures. The risk is assessed by a probabilistic engineering approach that considers the fire development and the individual-based evacuation process as well as the associated uncertainties. Advanced uncertainty propagation methods are applied in order to face the difficulties by using computational expensive models and by using individual-based models. Sensitivity measures are applied to reveal the contribution of the uncertainties on the estimation of the risk. The approach is applied for a risk-based optimisation of the minimal required door width for retail buildings.},

  abstract  = {To gain profit from complex chemical processes, it is essential to ensure its proper operation, i.e. to avoid costly unexpected downtimes of underlying processing units. This paper explores a highly efficient active fault detection and isolation (FDI) framework, which facilitates the discriminability of a set of analysed model candidates including the reference model (nominal behaviour) as well as pre-defined failure models (faulty behaviour). Practically, an auxiliary, model-discriminating input is derived by solving a dynamic optimization problem. While using a model-based approach, the active FDI implementation has to be robustified against the inherent model parameter uncertainties. To this end, a non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is used to address these uncertainties. To guarantee a computationally feasible performance, the original PCE setting has been considerably improved. Here, the basic idea is to render the design variables (auxiliary inputs) into random variables as well. Thus, the derived PCE results are not only sensitive to the model parameters but also to the design variables. To lower the computational burden further, a least angle regression strategy is applied utilizing the sparsity property of the PCE approach. The overall effectiveness of this One-Short Sparse Polynomial Chaos Expansion (OS2-PCE) concept for FDI is illustrated conceptually by analysing a tubular plug flow reactor.},

  abstract = {The objective of this research was to use numerical models based on mechanical approaches to improve the integration of the protective role of forests against rockfall into block propagation models. A model based on the discrete element method (DEM) was developed to take into account the complex mechanical processes involved during the impact of a block on a tree. This modelling approach requires the definition of many input parameters and cannot be directly integrated into block propagation models. A global sensitivity analysis identified the leading parameters of the block kinematics after impact (i.e. block energy reduction, trajectory changes, and rotational velocity): the impact velocity, the tree diameter, and the impact point horizontal location (i.e. eccentricity). Comparisons with the previous experimental and numerical studies of block impacts on trees demonstrated the applicability of the DEM model and showed some of the limitations of earlier approaches. Our sensitivity analysis highlights the significant influence of the impact velocity on the reduction of the blockâs kinetic energy. Previous approaches usually also focus on parameters such as impact height, impact vertical incidence, and tree species, whose importance is only minor according to the present results. This suggests that the integration of forest effects into block propagation models could be both improved and simplified. The DEM model can also be used as an alternative to classical approaches for the integration of forest effects by directly coupling it with block propagation models. This direct coupling only requires the additional definition of the location and the diameter of each tree. Indeed, the input parameters related to the mechanical properties of the stem and the block/stem interaction in the DEM model can be set to average values because they are not leading parameters. The other input parameters are already defined or calculated in the block propagation model.},

In this paper, an adaptive simulation framework recently proposed by some of the authors is tailored for the analysis of accident scenarios involving the control system of the Advanced Lead-cooled Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED). The results confirm that the adaptive simulation framework proposed is effective in identifying critical regions of operation with a limited number of calls to the computationally expensive model. The time of occurrence and magnitude of the failures of the components of the control system are identified as key factors to characterize the critical regions. In particular, it is shown that the order of occurrence of the componentsâ failures strongly affects the evolution of the accident scenarios.},

  abstract = {Bulk thermal conductivity estimates based on predictions from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) using the so-called direct method are known to be severely under-predicted since finite simulation length-scales are unable to mimic bulk transport. Moreover, subjecting the system to a temperature gradient by means of thermostatting tends to impact phonon transport adversely. Additionally, NEMD predictions are tightly coupled with the choice of the inter-atomic potential and the underlying values associated with its parameters. In the case of silicon (Si), nominal estimates of the Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential parameters are largely based on a constrained regression approach aimed at agreement with experimental data while ensuring structural stability. However, this approach has its shortcomings and it may not be ideal to use the same set of parameters to study a wide variety of Si-based systems subjected to different thermodynamic conditions. In this study, NEMD simulations are performed on a Si bar to investigate the impact of bar-length, and the applied temperature gradient on the discrepancy between predictions and the available measurement for bulk thermal conductivity at 300 K by constructing statistical response surfaces at different temperatures. The approach helps quantify the discrepancy, observed to be largely dependent on the system-size, with minimal computational effort. A computationally efficient approach based on derivative-based sensitivity measures to construct a reduced-order polynomial chaos surrogate for NEMD predictions is also presented. The surrogate is used to perform parametric sensitivity analysis, forward propagation of the uncertainty, and calibration of the important SW potential parameters in a Bayesian setting. It is found that only two (out of seven) parameters contribute significantly to the uncertainty in bulk thermal conductivity estimates for Si.},

In this paper, inverse Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) under the Bayesian framework is applied to BISON code FGR model based on RisÃ¸-AN3 time series experimental data. Inverse UQ seeks statistical descriptions of the uncertain input parameters that are consistent with the available measurement data. It always captures the uncertainties in its estimates rather than merely determining the best-fit values. Kriging metamodel is applied to greatly reduce the computational cost during Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. We performed a dimension reduction for the FGR time series data using Principal Component Analysis. We also projected the original FGR time series measurement data onto the PC subspace as âtransformed experiment dataâ. A forward uncertainty propagation based on the posterior distributions shows that the agreement between BISON simulation and Ris{\n}-AN3 time series measurement data is greatly improved. The posterior distributions for the uncertain input factors can be used to replace the expert specifications for future uncertainty/sensitivity analysis.},

Therefore, an efficient One-Shot Sparse Polynomial Chaos Expansion (OS2-PCE) based process design framework is introduced in this work. The key idea is to define the process design variables as uncertain quantities as well and, in consequence, they become an integral part of the robust optimization routine. Moreover, by utilizing the sparsity feature of the PCE approach, the implementation of a least angle regression (LAR) concept leads to a significant reduction in computational costs. The overall performance of the novel OS2-PCE approach is illustrated by a robust process design study of a jacketed tubular reactor. In comparison to state-of-the-art concepts, the proposed framework shows promising results in terms of efficiency and robustness.},

  abstract = {The dynamic models used for biological and chemical process analysis and design usually include a significant number of uncertain model parameters. Sensitivity analysis is frequently applied to provide quantitative information regarding the influence of the parameters, as well as their uncertainties, on the model output. Various techniques are available in the literature to calculate parameter sensitivities based on local derivatives or changes in dedicated statistical moments of the model output. However, these methods may lead to an inevitable loss of information for a proper sensitivity analysis and are not directly available for problems with correlated model parameters. In this work, we demonstrate the use of a moment-independent sensitivity analysis concept in the presence and absence of parameter correlations and investigate the correlation effect in more detail. Moment-independent sensitivity analysis calculates parameter sensitivities based on changes in the entire probability density distribution of the model output and is formulated independently of whether the parameters are correlated or not. Technically, a single-loop Monte Carlo simulation method in combination with polynomial chaos expansion is implemented to reduce the computational cost significantly. A sampling procedure derived from Gaussian copula formalism is used to generate sample points for arbitrarily correlated uncertain parameters. The proposed concept is demonstrated with a case study of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction network. We observe evident differences in the parameter sensitivities for cases with independent and correlated model parameters.},

  abstract = {Rice crops are important in global food economy and are monitored by precise agricultural methods, in which crop morphology in high spatial resolution becomes the point of interest. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology is being used for such agricultural purposes. Using polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data, plant morphology dependent electromagnetic scattering models can be used to approximate the backscattering behaviors of the crops. However, the inversion of such models for the morphology estimation is complex, ill-posed, and computationally expensive. Here, a metamodel-based probabilistic inversion algorithm is proposed to invert the morphology-based scattering model for the crop biophysical parameter mainly focusing on the crop height estimation. The accuracy of the proposed approach is tested with ground measured biophysical parameters on rice fields in two different bands (X and C) and several channel combinations. Results show that in C-band the combination of the HH and VV channels has the highest overall accuracy through the crop growth cycle. Finally, the proposed metamodel-based probabilistic biophysical parameter retrieval algorithm allows estimation of rice crop height using PolSAR data with high accuracy and low computation cost. This research provides a new perspective on the use of PolSAR data in modern precise agriculture studies.},

In this paper a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method is proposed to evaluate the impact of variable energy resources on the maximum loadability of islanded MGs (IMGs). First, a probabilistic optimization problem is formulated to calculate the IMG load margin considering the droop characteristics of DG units and uncertainties of renewable generation, loads and distribution feeder parameters. Then, the global sensitivity (GS) is introduced that can identify the impact of independent and correlated variables on the IMG loadability. Next, the sparse polynomial chaos expansion (SPCE) method is used to obtain the probabilistic models for IMG load margins, and an efficient GSA method is proposed to calculate the GS of IMG loadability to prevailing variables. The probabilistic models are considered for IMG input variables and the impact of variable correlations on IMG loadability is analyzed. The proposed method for calculating the maximum loadability is tested using a 33-bus IMG and the results are compared with those of other GSA and local sensitivity analysis (LSA) methods.},

The second approach evaluates the inversion of a metamodel-driven electromagnetic backscattering model by including a priori morphological information. The third approach combines the previous two processes.

The results of presented height estimation algorithms demonstrated the advantage of Pol-InSAR data.

  abstract     = {Inverse modeling is vital for an improved hydrological prediction. However, this process can be computationally demanding as it usually requires a large number of model evaluations. To address this issue, one can take advantage of surrogate modeling techniques, e.g., the one based on sparse polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). Nevertheless, when structural error of the surrogate model is neglected in inverse modeling, the inversion results will be biased. In this paper, we develop a surrogate-based Bayesian inversion framework that rigorously quantifies and gradually eliminates the structural error of the surrogate. Specifically, two strategies are proposed and compared. The first strategy works by obtaining an ensemble of sparse PCE surrogates with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, while the second one uses Gaussian process (GP) to simulate the structural error of a single sparse PCE surrogate. With an active learning process, the surrogate structural error can be gradually reduced to a negligible level in the posterior region, where the original input-output relationship can be much more easily captured by PCE than in the prior. Demonstrated by one numerical case of groundwater contaminant source identification with 28 unknown input variables, it is found that both strategies can efficiently reduce the bias introduced by surrogate modeling, while the second strategy has a better performance as it integrates two methods (i.e., PCE and GP) that complement each other.},

  abstract     = {Few systems have been developed for simultaneous measurement of thermal, electrical, and thermoelectric properties at high temperatures (> 600K) relevant to high temperature waste heat recovery applications. The Z-Meter approach enables simultaneous measurements of the three thermoelectric properties from which the figure of merit, ZT, is calculated. The method combines an ASTM D5470 reference bar measurement for thermal conductivity (often used for thermal interface materials) with the added functionality of electrical measurements for electrical conductivity and Seebeck Coefficient. Traditionally, this technique has been employed utilizing a very small temperature difference across the sample (ÎT â 1 - 2K) and test temperatures between approximately 300 - 600K, but thermoelectric materials must generally have sizable temperature gradients across them to achieve desirable performance as increased operating temperatures generally allow access to higher grade waste heat, and the relevant properties are also significantly temperature dependent. Here, we design a Z-meter system to evaluate the performance of materials under large temperature differences relevant to such applications. The design of the instrument is driven by uncertainty quantification to minimize measurement error. A detailed design of experiments model enables informed decisions regarding the component and system designs (e.g. placement of the temperature sensors). This design of experiments model includes effects of radiative losses in the meter bars as well as the losses due to the measurement probes installed along the bars. The system as designed is capable of hot side temperatures of 1350K with the thermoelectric material to temperature gradients on the order of 500K. The elevated temperatures are necessary to fill a gap in characterization equipment for very high temperature thermoelectric applications. The measurement system requires vacuum pressure of 1 Î¼Torr for suppression of convection losses and to prevent of oxidation of the hot system components. The system design employs a loading platform that allows the interfacial sample/bar loading to be changed in situ without breaking system vacuum allowing for high measurement throughput. Additionally, a triad of integrated load cells ensure repeatable loading conditions for the sample interface. The combination of simultaneous thermal, electrical, and thermoelectric properties at high temperatures with controlled mechanical loading opens the doors to new understanding of thermoelectrics for high temperature waste heat recovery. Ultimately, this uncertainty analysis coupled with the design process demonstrates the limits of using this system and guides operating conditions for given expected sampleproperties.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the use of multiple kernel functions for assisting single-objective Kriging-based efficient global optimization (EGO). The primary objective is to improve the robustness of EGO in terms of the choice of kernel function for solving a variety of black-box optimization problems in engineering design. Specifically, three widely used kernel functions are studied, that is, Gaussian, MatÃ©rn-3/2, and MatÃ©rn-5/2 function. We investigate both model selection and ensemble techniques based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) and cross-validation error on a set of synthetic (noiseless and noisy) and non-algebraic (aerodynamic and parameter tuning) optimization problems; in addition, the use of cross-validation-based local (i.e., pointwise) ensemble is also studied. Since all the constituent surrogate models in the ensemble scheme are Kriging models, it is possible to perform EGO since the Kriging uncertainty structure is still preserved. Through analyses of empirical experiments, it is revealed that the ensemble techniques improve the robustness and performance of EGO. It is also revealed that the use of MatÃ©rn-kernels yields better results than those of the Gaussian kernel when EGO with a single kernel is considered. Furthermore, we observe that model selection methods do not yield any substantial improvement over single kernel EGO. When averaged across all types of problem (i.e., noise level, dimensionality, and synthetic/non-algebraic), the local ensemble technique achieves the best performance.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric chemistry transport models (ACTMs) are extensively used to provide scientific support for the development of policies to mitigate against the detrimental effects of air pollution on human health and ecosystems. Therefore, it is essential to quantitatively assess the level of model uncertainty and to identify the model input parameters that contribute the most to the uncertainty. For complex process-based models, such as ACTMs, uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses are still challenging and are often limited by computational constraints due to the requirement of a large number of model runs. In this work, we demonstrate an emulator-based approach to uncertainty quantification and variance-based sensitivity analysis for the EMEP4UK model (regional application of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme Meteorological Synthesizing Centre-West). A separate Gaussian process emulator was used to estimate model predictions at unsampled points in the space of the uncertain model inputs for every modelled grid cell. The training points for the emulator were chosen using an optimised Latin hypercube sampling design. The uncertainties in surface concentrations of O3, NO2, and PM2.5 were propagated from the uncertainties in the anthropogenic emissions of NOx, SO2, NH3, VOC, and primary PM2.5 reported by the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory. The results of the EMEP4UK uncertainty analysis for the annually averaged model predictions indicate that modelled surface concentrations of O3, NO2, and PM2.5 have the highest level of uncertainty in the grid cells comprising urban areas (up to \pm 7\%, \pm 9\%, and \pm 9\% respectively). The uncertainty in the surface concentrations of O3 and NO2 were dominated by uncertainties in NOx emissions combined from non-dominant sectors (i.e. all sectors excluding energy production and road transport) and shipping emissions. Additionally, uncertainty in OO3 was driven by uncertainty VOC emissions combined from sectors excluding solvent use. Uncertainties in the modelled PM2.5 concentrations were mainly driven by uncertainties in primary PM2.5 emissions and NH3 emissions from the agricultural sector. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were also performed for five selected grid sells for monthly averaged model predictions to illustrate the seasonal change in the magnitude of uncertainty and change in the contribution of different model inputs to the overall uncertainty. Our study demonstrates the viability of a Gaussian process emulator-based approach for uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses, which can be applied to other ACTMs. Conducting these analyses helps to increase the confidence in model predictions. Additionally, the emulators created for these analyses can be used to predict the ACTM response for any other combination of perturbed input emissions within the ranges set for the original Latin hypercube sampling design without the need to re-run the ACTM, thus allowing fast exploratory assessments at significantly reduced computational costs.},

Both descriptions are coupled through a two-way approach which accounts for the effects of the continuous phase on the droplets and the retroaction of the droplets on the carrier phase. Several experiments available in the literature have been used to calibrate the physical models involved in the numerical prediction of evaporating sprays (see [6][7]). The present study focuses on the simulation of evaporative sprays taking into account existing experimental and modeling uncertainties. Due to the significant cost of the numerical prediction, a surrogate model is used to quantify the effect of these uncertainties on quantities of interest. The non-intrusive Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) technique available in the uncertainty quantification framework software UQLab is coupled with the deterministic Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver to yield statistical outputs (typically mean value and variance) of key quantities, such as the liquid mass flow rate for instance. The study analyzes the sensitivity of these outputs to experimental uncertainties on the continuous and discrete phase inputs (gas inlet velocity distribution, inlet liquid mass flow rate) and to modeling uncertainties in the turbulent dispersion model and evaporation model.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a robust framework for history matching which employs a sequential execution of sensitivity analysis, proxy modeling and inverse optimization to determine the optimized parameter space of model parameters. A mechanistic surfactant-polymer (SP) flood model is considered for history matching with an ultimate goal of accurately calibrating models that describe physical subprocesses of surfactant flooding, polymer flooding and displacement process. The employed model calibration algorithm starts with Sobol sensitivity analysis which reduces the large uncertain space of model parameters to determine the most important stochastic variables. The resulting low-dimensional parameter space is then represented via appropriate orthonormal basis of polynomial chaos expansion (PCE-proxy). An inverse optimization problem is then posed that minimizes the miss-fit between PCE-proxy response and experimental observations by employing a Genetic Algorithm. Finally, the epistemic uncertainty in PCE-proxy is quantified by combining it with a Gaussian regression process called Kriging.

We use this framework to calibrate the SP flood model by history matching a single coreflood experiment for quantities of interest such as pressure drop profile and cumulative oil recovery curve. We then show that the calibrated model is successfully able to predict all our quantities of interest for two other coreflood experiments without any ad-hoc tuning of parameters. The proposed proxy-accelerated inverse optimization framework shows significant promise for model calibration or to improve the quality of history matched results.},

  abstract = {The ever-increasing complexity of numerical models and associated computational demands have challenged classical reliability analysis methods. Surrogate model-based reliability analysis techniques, and in particular those using kriging meta-model, have gained considerable attention recently for their ability to achieve high accuracy and computational efficiency. However, existing stopping criteria, which are used to terminate the training of surrogate models, do not directly relate to the error in estimated failure probabilities. This limitation can lead to high computational demands because of unnecessary calls to costly performance functions (e.g., involving finite element models) or potentially inaccurate estimates of failure probability due to premature termination of the training process. Here, we propose the error-based stopping criterion (ESC) to address these limitations. First, it is shown that the total number of wrong sign estimation of the performance function for candidate design samples by kriging, S, follows a Poisson binomial distribution. This finding is subsequently used to estimate the lower and upper bounds of S for a given confidence level for sets of candidate design samples classified by kriging as safe and unsafe. An upper bound of error of the estimated failure probability is subsequently derived according to the probabilistic properties of Poisson binomial distribution. The proposed upper bound is implemented in the kriging-based reliability analysis method as the stopping criterion. The efficiency and robustness of ESC are investigated here using five benchmark reliability analysis problems. Results indicate that the proposed method achieves the set accuracy target and substantially reduces the computational demand, in some cases by over 50\%.},

Here, a simple model that can predict bending deformation as a function of moisture content change, wood material parameters, and geometry is presented. We consider material anisotropy and moisture-dependency of elastic mechanical parameters. The model is validated using experimental data collected on bilayers made out of European beech wood. Furthermore, we present essential design aspects in view of facilitated industrial applications. Layer thickness, thickness-ratio, and growth ring angle of the wood in single layers are assessed by their effect on curvature, stored elastic energy, and generated axial stress.

  abstract   = {The complexity and size of state-of-the-art cell models have significantly increased in part due to the requirement that these models possess complex cellular functions which are thought--but not necessarily proven--to be important. Modern cell models often involve hundreds of parameters; the values of these parameters come, more often than not, from animal experiments whose relationship to the human physiology is weak with very little information on the errors in these measurements. The concomitant uncertainties in parameter values result in uncertainties in the model outputs or Quantities of Interest (QoIs). Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) aims at apportioning to individual parameters (or sets of parameters) their relative contribution to output uncertainty thereby introducing a measure of influence or importance of said parameters. New GSA approaches are required to deal with increased model size and complexity; a three stage methodology consisting of screening (dimension reduction), surrogate modeling, and computing Sobol' indices, is presented. The methodology is used to analyze a physiologically validated numerical model of neurovascular coupling which possess 160 uncertain parameters. The sensitivity analysis investigates three quantities of interest (QoIs), the average value of $K^+$ in the extracellular space, the average volumetric flow rate through the perfusing vessel, and the minimum value of the actin/myosin complex in the smooth muscle cell. GSA provides a measure of the influence of each parameter, for each of the three QoIs, giving insight into areas of possible physiological dysfunction and areas of further investigation.},

  abstract = {As models in various fields are becoming more complex, associated computational demands have been increasing significantly. Reliability analysis for these systems when failure probabilities are small is very challenging, requiring a large number of costly simulations. To address this challenge, this paper introduces Reliability analysis through Error rate-based Adaptive Kriging (REAK). An extension of the Central Limit Theorem based on Lindeberg condition is adopted here to derive the distribution of the number of design samples with wrong sign estimate and subsequently determine the maximum error rate for failure probability estimates. This error rate enables optimal establishment of effective sampling regions at each stage of an adaptive scheme for strategic generation of design samples. Moreover, it facilitates setting a target accuracy for failure probability estimation, which is used as the stopping criterion for reliability analysis. These capabilities together can significantly reduce the number of calls to sophisticated, computationally demanding models. The application of REAK for four examples with varying extent of nonlinearity and dimension is presented. Results indicate that REAK is able to reduce the computational demand by as high as 50\% compared to the state-of-the-art methods of Adaptive Kriging with Monte Carlo Simulation (AK-MCS) and Improved Sequential Kriging Reliability Analysis (ISKRA).},

Practical bounds for the database and calibration are defined via nine environmental variables, and their relative effects on the fatigue loads are evaluated by means of Sobol sensitivity indices. Of the surrogate-model methods, polynomial chaos expansion provides an accurate and robust performance in prediction of the different site-specific loads.

  abstract   = {This paper analyzes the effects of input uncertainties on the outputs of a three dimensional natural convection problem in a differentially heated cubical enclosure. Two different cases are considered for parameter uncertainty propagation and global sensitivity analysis. In case A, stochastic variation is introduced in the two non-dimensional parameters (Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers) with an assumption that the temperature boundary condition is uniform. Being a two dimensional stochastic problem, the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method is used as a surrogate model. Case B deals with non-uniform stochasticity in the boundary temperature. Instead of the traditional Gaussian process model with the Karhunen-Lo$\grave{e}$ve expansion, a novel approach is successfully implemented to model uncertainty in the boundary condition. The boundary is divided into multiple domains and the temperature imposed on each domain is assumed to be an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variable. Deep neural networks are trained with the boundary temperatures as inputs and Nusselt number, internal temperature or velocities as outputs. The number of domains which is essentially the stochastic dimension is 4, 8, 16 or 32. Rigorous training and testing process shows that the neural network is able to approximate the outputs to a reasonable accuracy. For a high stochastic dimension like 32, it is computationally expensive to fit the PCE. This paper demonstrates a novel way of using the deep neural network as a surrogate modeling method of uncertainty quantification with the number simulations much lesser than that required for fitting the PCE thus, saving the computational cost.},

Uncertain variation in energy demand is a challenge in the design of charging systems and on-board energy storages. To predict the energy demand, a computationally efficient model is required for real-time applications. We present a novel approach to predict energy demand variation with a wide range of uncertain factors. A factor identification is carried out to recognize the range of variation in the operating conditions. A computationally efficient surrogate model is generated based on a previously developed numerical simulation model. The surrogate model is shown to be 10â¯000 times faster than the numerical model. The surrogate model output corresponds with the numerical model with less than 1\% error. The energy demand of the surrogate model varied from 0.43 to 2.30â¯kWh/km, which is realistic in comparison to previous studies. Successful sensitivity analysis of the surrogate model revealed the most crucial factors. Uncertainty in temperature, rolling resistance and payload contributed most to the variation in energy demand. Variation in these factors should be taken into account when predicting energy consumption and while planning schedules for a bus network.},

probability density function (PDF) of the performance function. This scheme first promptly provides an estimated fractional orders and Lagrange multipliers by solving a linear system of equations as initial values, and then searches the more accurate solutions around the initial values to recover the PDF. Besides, the local optimum can be avoided by using the estimator-corrector scheme. The centered L2 (CL2) discrepancy oriented sequential Latin-hyper cube simulation is proposed to evaluate the low-order fractional moments involved in MEM, which is of critical importance to the efficiency and accuracy for high dimensional reliability analysis. Typical numerical examples are investigated to validate the proposed method.

  abstract = {Many reinforced concrete bridges in Europe and around the world are damaged by reinforcement corrosion and the annual maintenance costs are enormous. It is therefore important to develop reliable methods to assess the structural capacity of corroded reinforced concrete structures and avoid unnecessary maintenance costs. Although there are advanced models for determining the load carrying capacity of structures, it is not obvious how they should be used to verify the performance of existing structures. To confidently assess the bond of corroded reinforcement in concrete, for example, the calculation model must give a sufficient safety margin. When designing new structures, semi-probabilistic approaches (such as the partial safety factor method) are adopted to achieve the target reliabilities specified in structural design codes. This paper uses probabilistic methods to develop partial factors for application in an existing bond model, to assess the safety of corroded reinforced concrete structures. The response of the bond model was studied using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for several design cases, with probability distributions fitted to the results. Partial factors were then derived, based on these distributions. Furthermore, an MC-based simulation technique called âimportance samplingâ was used to study the reliability of several deterministic bond assessments conducted using these partial factors. The results show that deterministic assessments which use the proposed partial factors lead to a safety level at least equal to the target value. The results presented in this paper will support the assessment of reinforced concrete structures with anchorage problems and give a reasonable approximation of the anchorage capacity with sufficient safety margin. When generalised to cover other failure modes and structural configurations, this will enable better utilisation of damaged structures and lead to major environmental and economical savings for society.},

  abstract = {Gaussian process emulation (GPE) and polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) are tools for meta-model-based uncertainty propagation analysis (UPA) that have gained increasing attention in recent groundwater literature. Previous studies have shown that these two meta-models can provide satisfactorily accurate estimations of the model response in a wide range of groundwater UPA problems. However, PCE and GPE are based on very different mathematical concepts, and a question that arises is which one of these is more suitable for groundwater UPA. The current paper aims to provide an answer to this question by first presenting a theoretical comparison of the two meta-models, then reviewing previous comparisons of the two in other fields of engineering, and subsequently presenting an empirical comparison based on groundwater case studies. For this purpose, both meta-models are applied to two hypothetical test cases corresponding to seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers. The results show that: (1) GPE outperforms PCE in the estimation of the inputâoutput relationships, by providing smaller root mean square errors. (2) In most cases assessed, PCE provides better accuracy in the estimation of
mean, standard deviation and the entire shape and the tail of probability distribution functions. (3) Replicates of PCE show less statistical dispersion in the estimation of mean and standard deviations. (4) A trend of increase in the predominance of PCE over GPE can be identified as the probability distributions that are meant to be estimated become noisier and more multi-modal.},

  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {Researchers have been investigating data-driven modeling as a key way to achieve ship intelligence for years. This paper presents a novel data analysis approach to data-driven modeling of ship motion. We propose a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) approach combining artificial neural network (ANN) and sparse polynomial chaos expansion (SPCE) techniques to accommodate high-dimensional sensor data collected from ship motion. An ANN is constructed as a surrogate model to associate ship sensor data with a certain type of ship motion. To account for the computational efficiency of GSA, an SPCE is integrated into the GSA to decrease the need for Monte Carlo (MC) samples generated by the ANN. A probe variable is designed to couple with the MC samples, which plays a role in determining the degree of convergence of variable importance. A test on benchmark function demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach. A case study of ship heading with and without environment effects is conducted. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can identify and rank the most sensitive factors of ship motion. The proposed approach highlights the application of GSA in data-driven modeling for ship intelligence.},

  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {In this paper, a novel non-intrusive probabilistic power flow (PPF) analysis method based on the low-rank approximation (LRA) is proposed, which can accurately and efficiently estimate the probabilistic characteristics (e.g., mean, variance, probability density function) of the PPF solutions. This method aims at building up a statistically-equivalent surrogate for the PPF solutions through a small number of power flow evaluations. By exploiting the retained tensor-product form of the univariate polynomial basis, a sequential correction-updating scheme is applied, making the total number of unknowns to be linear rather than exponential to the number of random inputs. Consequently, the LRA method is particularly promising for dealing with high-dimensional problems with a large number of random inputs. Numerical studies on the IEEE 39-bus, 118-bus, and 1354-bus systems show that the proposed method can achieve accurate probabilistic characteristics of the PPF solutions with much less computational effort compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. Even compared to the polynomial chaos expansion method, the LRA method can achieve comparable accuracy, while the LRA method is more capable of handling higher-dimensional problems. Moreover, numerical results reveal that the randomness brought about by the renewable energy resources and loads may inevitably affect the feasibility of dispatch/planning schemes.},

  abstract = {In this study we use polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to perform uncertainty analysis for seawater intrusion (SWI) in fractured coastal aquifers (FCAs) which is simulated using the coupled discrete fracture network (DFN) and variable-density flow (VDF) models. The DFN-VDF model requires detailed discontinuous analysis of the fractures. In real field applications, these characteristics are usually uncertain which may have a major effect on the predictive capability of the model. Thus, we perform global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to provide a preliminary assessment on how these uncertainties can affect the model outputs. As our conceptual model, we consider fractured configurations of the Henry Problem which is widely used to understand SWI processes. A finite element DFN-VDF model is developed in the framework of COMSOL Multiphysics. We examine the uncertainty of several SWI metrics and salinity distribution due to the incomplete knowledge of fracture characteristics. PCE is used as a surrogate model to reduce the computational burden. A new sparse PCE technique is used to allow for high polynomial orders at low computational cost. The Sobolâ indices (SIs) are used as sensitivity measures to identify the key variables driving the model outputs uncertainties. The proposed GSA methodology based on PCE and SIs is useful for identifying the source of uncertainties on the model outputs with an affordable computational cost and an acceptable accuracy. It shows that fracture hydraulic conductivity is the first source of uncertainty on the salinity distribution. The imperfect knowledge of fracture location and density affects mainly the toe position and the total flux of saltwater entering the aquifer. Marginal effects based on the PCE are used to understand the effects of fracture characteristics on SWI. The findings provide a technical support for monitoring, controlling and preventing SWI in FCAs.},

Notably, various studies have discussed the back-off concept to solve the underlying robust optimization problem; however, for the concept to have practical value, its efficiency and convergence must be improved. In this work, we introduce a novel, highly efficient stochastic back-off strategy. Instead of using statistical moments of limited validity, we incorporate the full statistical information of the constraints to solve the robust process design problem. To ensure manageable computational costs, we make use of polynomial chaos expansion for uncertainty quantification and propagation. The proposed concept is demonstrated with the design of a tubular crystallizer for ibuprofen crystallization. The results show that the novel stochastic back-off strategy is considerably faster compared with the standard back-off concept and provides more reliable quality by design results in general.},

  abstract = {Biofuel production from oilseed trees in smallâscale agroforestry systems is considered as a strategy for energy security, rural development and ecosystem services provision in lowâincome countries. However, the economic potential of these systems remains unclear, as profitability studies commonly ignore key methodological issues such as quantitative uncertainty analysis, full accounting for opportunity costs, and inclusion of all value chain actors. This study addresses these methodological shortcomings and develops a framework for quantifying the longâterm financial performance of agroforestryâbased biofuel value chains. The framework is applied to a case in South India, to calculate profitability of pongamia (Millettia pinnata) cultivation and processing. The results show that pongamia cultivation has limited financial potential, and is only profitable in smallâscale settings, in the middle to long term and for a subset of farmers. If biodiesel is envisaged as the end product, the value chain requires substantial fiscal and marketing support to be economically viable. For current prices, financial performance is much higher if the seed oil is marketed instead of processed to biodiesel. Increased mechanization, increased yields and optimized agroforestry setâups might improve financial outcomes and reduce risks for both farmers and processors. These findings are caseâspecific, while the developed framework opens the door to comprehensive investigation of the financial performance of other oilseed tree species and in other regions.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty quantification of engineering systems modeled by computationally intensive numerical models remains a challenging task, despite the increase in computer power. Efficient uncertainty propagation of such models can be performed by use of surrogate models, such as polynomial chaos expansions (PCE). A major drawback of standard PCE is that its predictive ability decreases with increase of the problem dimension for a fixed computational budget. This is related to the fact that the number of terms in the expansion increases fast with the input variable dimension. To address this issue, Tipireddy and Ghanem (2014) introduced a sparse PCE representation based on a transformation of the coordinate system in Gaussian input variable spaces. In this contribution, we propose to identify the projection operator underlying this transformation and approximate the coefficients of the resulting PCE through partial least squares (PLS) analysis. The proposed PCE-driven PLS algorithm identifies the directions with the largest predictive significance in the PCE representation based on a set of samples from the input random variables and corresponding response variable. This approach does not require gradient evaluations, which makes it efficient for high dimensional problems with black-box numerical models. We assess the proposed approach with three numerical examples in high-dimensional input spaces, comparing its performance with low-rank tensor approximations. These examples demonstrate that the PLS-based PCE method provides accurate representations even for strongly non-linear problems.},

The computational cost of full PCE is unaffordable due to the âcurse of dimensionalityâ of the expansion coefficients. In this paper, an expanded sparse Bayesian learning method for sparse PCE is proposed. Firstly, basis polynomials of the full PCE are partitioned into significant terms and complementary non-significant terms. The parameterized priors with distinct variance are assigned to the candidates for the significant terms. Then, the dimensionality of the parameter space is equivalent to the assumed sparsity level of the PCE. Secondly, an approximate Kashyap information criterion (KIC) rule which achieves a balance between model simplicity and goodness of fit is derived for model selection. Finally, an automatic search algorithm is proposed by minimizing the KIC objective function and using the variance contribution of each term to the model output to select significant terms. To assess the performance of the proposed method, a detailed comparison is completed with several well-established techniques. The results show that the proposed method is able to identify the most significant PC contributions with superior efficiency and accuracy.},

  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {Due to an increased need in hydro-electricity, water storage, and flood protection, it is assumed that a series of new dams will be build throughout the world. The focus of this paper is on the non-probabilistic-based design of new arch-type dams by applying means of robust design optimization (RDO). This type of optimization takes into account uncertainties in the loads and in the material properties of the structure. As classical procedures of probabilistic-based optimization under uncertainties, such as RDO and reliability-based design optimization (RBDO), are in general computationally expensive and rely on estimates of the systemâs response variance, we will not follow a full-probabilistic approach but work with predefined confidence levels. This leads to a bi-level optimization program where the volume of the dam is optimized under the worst combination of the uncertain parameters. As a result, robust and reliable designs are obtained and the result is independent from any assumptions on stochastic properties of the random variables in the model. The optimization of an arch-type dam is realized here by a robust optimization method under load uncertainty, where hydraulic and thermal loads are considered. The load uncertainty is modeled as an ellipsoidal expression. Comparing with any traditional deterministic optimization method, which only concerns the minimum objective value and offers a solution candidate close to limit-states, the RDO method provides a robust solution against uncertainty. To reduce the computational cost, a ranking strategy and an approximation model are further involved to do a preliminary screening. By this means, the robust design can generate an improved arch dam structure that ensures both safety and serviceability during its lifetime.},

We present the recently introduced weighted Leja interpolation rules, along with a dimension-adaptive sparse interpolation algorithm, to be employed in the case of high-dimensional input uncertainty. The performance and reliability of the suggested approach is verified by the results of three numerical experiments, where the respective models feature extreme value and truncated normal input distributions.

  abstract  = {In the framework of BEPU (Best Estimate Plus Uncertainty) methodology, the uncertainties involved in simulations must be quantified to prove that the investigated design is reasonable and acceptable. The uncertainties in predictions are usually calculated by propagating input uncertainties through the simulation model, which requires prior knowledge of the model or code input uncertainties, for example, the means, variances, distribution types, etc. However, in best-estimate system thermal-hydraulics codes such as TRACE, some parameters in empirical correlations may have large uncertainties which are unknown to code users. So, the uncertainties associated these parameters are simply ignored or described by âexpert opinionâ. Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is performed in the current study to replace such ad-hoc expert judgment. Inverse UQ is the process of quantifying the uncertainties in input parameters given relevant experimental measurements. The purpose of inverse UQ, and this paper, is to seek statistical descriptions of the input model parameters that are consistent with the observed data. Bayesian analysis is used to formulate the inverse UQ problem given relevant experiment data. In this study, the steady-state PSBT benchmark void fraction data is used. Within the Bayesian framework we seek the posterior distributions of the uncertain TRACE modeling parameters, which is updated from our prior knowledge given measurement data. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is used to explore the posterior distributions, and surrogate models of TRACE are used to alleviate the computational burden. Gaussian Process (GP) is used to construct the surrogate model which can reduce the simulation time significantly. The outcomes will be the posterior distributions of several modeling parameters that are significant to PSBT experiment. Results of inverse UQ can be used for future forward uncertainty propagation and validation analysis, which will be presented in a companion paper.},

  abstract  = {For best estimate thermal-hydraulics codes like TRACE and RELAP5, one major source of uncertainties is the inaccuracy of closure laws (correlations) which are used to describe transfer terms in balance equations. These closure laws were originally studied in separate-effect experiments but are implemented in thermal-hydraulics codes and used for different conditions. Thus, the model parameters involved in such closure laws may have significant influences on model outputs but are subject to considerable uncertainties. The aim of this paper is to perform sensitivity and uncertainty study with respect to selected physical model parameters in TRACE. The PSBT steady-state void fraction data is used as Quantity-of-Interest (QoI). Statistics of these physical model parameters are obtained by inverse Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) from a companion paper. Sensitivity Analysis (SA) aims at determining how uncertain input parameters contribute to the variations of outputs. In this paper, the Sobol' indices are used as a sensitivity measure, which quantify how the variation in a QoI can be apportioned to each input factor. Based on the results from SA, several input parameters that have significant effects on the QoI are selected for the UQ process. The prediction uncertainty is evaluated by considering the propagation of uncertainties in selected TRACE physical model parameters. As thousands of TRACE runs are needed for the sensitivity and uncertainty studies, the use of direct Monte Carlo sampling is not a viable solution. We developed Gaussian Process (GP) emulator as a surrogate model of TRACE to reduce the computation time substantially.},

  abstract = {Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is a powerful tool for quantifying the effects of model parameters on the performance outputs of engineering systems, such as wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Due to the ever-growing sophistication of such systems and their models, significantly longer processing times are required to perform a system-wide simulation, which makes the use of traditional Monte Carlo (MC) based approaches for calculation of GSA measures, such as Sobol indices, impractical. In this work, we present a systematic framework to construct and validate highly accurate meta-models to perform an efficient GSA of complex WWTP models such as the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2). The robustness and the efficacy of three meta-modeling approaches, namely polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and artificial neural networks (ANN), are tested on four engineering scenarios. The results reveal significant computational gains of the proposed framework over the MC-based approach without compromising accuracy.},

  abstract = {Real-time hybrid substructuring (RTHS) is a cyber-physical vibration testing method that partitions a structural system into numerical and physical substructures. RTHS incorporates sensing, actuation, and computing technologies to couple these substructures in real time. RTHS can be used to realistically examine the performance of structural systems with rate-dependent structural components that may be difficult to accurately model. However, uncertainty can be found in many aspects of RTHS testing including noise in sensor measurements, actuator performance and tracking, non-linearities in the physical test specimen, and numerical modeling assumptions. In the numerical substructure, uncertainty in material properties, stiffness, damping, or geometry may be considered random variables. Certain physical substructure characteristics may also be similarly parameterized. This thesis aims to develop and experimentally validate techniques that incorporate these parametric uncertainties into RTHS testing protocols, thereby improving the robustness of the RTHS method. This goal was accomplished through two studies.

First, a study was performed to extend and experimentally validate a proposed structural reliability method called Adaptive Kriging-Hybrid Simulation (AK-HS). The method combines a metamodeling technique known as Kriging, an adaptive learning algorithm, the Monte Carlo method, and RTHS testing to iteratively estimate a structural systemâs probability of failure given random parameters in the numerical substructure. The method was validated with a series of bench-scale RTHS tests of a Taylor Devices, Inc. viscous damper connecting two adjacent 6-degree-of-freedom rigid body structures. The AK-HS method was found to accurately predict probabilities of failure for systems with up to 24 random variables using a reasonable number of RTHS tests.

The second study proposed and validated a method that can be used to develop metamodels of a systemâs frequency response functions using Principal Component Analysis, Kriging, and RTHS. The proposed method was experimentally validated through a series of bench-scale RTHS tests of a Lord Corporation magnetorheological fluid damper controlling vibrations in a 2-degree-of-freedom mass-spring system subjected to an input ground acceleration. Uncertainty was introduced to the system by treating the numerical substructure spring stiffnesses and the physical damper current as random variables. It is shown that accurate, statistical metamodels can be created using a small number of RTHS tests. These metamodels may then be used to conduct Monte Carlo simulations to obtain distributions of the systemâs frequency domain response behavior.},

Typically, the physical substructure consists of a system component whose behavior is difficult to model while the numerical substructure consists of a computational model of the remainder of the system. Hybrid substructuring has previously been shown to be an effective method to quantify the effect of parametric uncertainties in the numerical substructure on the response of the system. This paper proposes and implements a methodology where the effect of parametric uncertainty can also be incorporated into the physical substructure. This idea is implemented in a series of small-scale Real-Time Hybrid Substructuring (RTHS) tests on a magneto-rheological fluid damper used to control a two degree-of-freedom mass-spring system. The physical current supplied to the damper is treated as a random variable. Using the RTHS test results, a metamodel of the systemâs frequency domain behavior is developed using Principal Component Analysis and Kriging. This metamodel is then used to evaluate probabilistic system performance.},

  abstract = {Recent  studies  have  indicated  that  Huff-n-Puff  (HNP)  gas  injection  has  the  potential  to  recover  anadditional 30-70\% oil from multi-fractured horizontal wells in shale reservoirs. Nonetheless, this techniqueis very sensitive to production constraints and is impacted by uncertainty related to measurement quality(particularly frequency and resolution), and lack of constraining data. In this paper, a Bayesian workflow isprovided to optimize the HNP process under uncertainty using a Duvernay shale well as an example.Compositional simulations are conducted which incorporate a tuned PVT model and a set of measuredcyclic injection/compaction pressure-sensitive permeability data. Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) is used to estimate  the  posterior  distributions  of  the  model  uncertain  variables  by  matching  the  primaryproduction data. The McMC process is accelerated by employing an accurate proxy model (kriging) whichis updated using a highly adaptive sampling algorithm. Gaussian Processes are then used to optimize theHNP control variables by maximizing the lower confidence interval (Î¼-Ï) of cumulative oil production(after 10 years) across a fixed ensemble of uncertain variables sampled from posterior distributions.The uncertain variable space includes several parameters representing reservoir and fracture properties.The posterior distributions for some parameters, such as primary fracture permeability and effective half-length, are narrower, while wider distributions are obtained for other parameters. The results indicate thatthe impact of uncertain variables on HNP performance is nonlinear. Some uncertain variables (such asmolecular diffusion) that do not show strong sensitivity during the primary production strongly impact gasinjection HNP performance. The results of optimization under uncertainty confirm that the lower confidenceinterval  of  cumulative  oil  production  can  be  maximized  by  an  injection  time  of  around 1.5 months,  aproduction time of around 2.5 months, and very short soaking times. In addition, a maximum injection rateand a flowing bottomhole pressure around the bubble point are required to ensure maximum incrementalrecovery. Analysis of the objective function surface highlights some other sets of production constraintswith competitive results. Finally, the optimal set of production constraints, in combination with an ensembleof uncertain variables, results in a median HNP cumulative oil production that is 30\% greater than that forprimary production. 

The application of a Bayesian framework for optimizing the HNP performance in a real shale reservoir isintroduced for the first time. This work provides practical guidelines for the efficient application of advancedmachine learning techniques for optimization under uncertainty, resulting in better decision making.},

The development of surrogates requires modeling highâdimensional and nonsmooth functions with limited information. To this end, the hybrid surrogate modeling method, where different surrogate models are combined, offers an effective solution. In this paper, a new hybrid modeling technique is proposed by combining polynomial chaos expansion and kernel function in a sparse Bayesian learning framework. The proposed hybrid model possesses both the global characteristic advantage of polynomial chaos expansion and the local characteristic advantage of the Gaussian kernel. The parameterized priors are utilized to encourage the sparsity of the model. Moreover, an optimization algorithm aiming at maximizing Bayesian evidence is proposed for parameter optimization. To assess the performance of the proposed method, a detailed comparison is made with the wellâestablished PCâKriging technique. The results show that the proposed method is superior in terms of accuracy and robustness.},

This paper presents a rigorous yet efficient methodology to develop fragility models and perform risk assessments of ASTs subjected to combined surge, wave, and wind loads. Parametrized fragility models are derived for buckling and dislocation from the ground. The buckling strength of ASTs is assessed using finite element analysis, while the stability against dislocation is evaluated using analytical limit state functions with surrogate modeling-based load models. Scenario and probabilistic risk assessments are then performed for a case study region by convolving the fragility models with hazard models. Results demonstrate that the derived fragility models are efficient tools to evaluate the performance of ASTs in industrial regions. Insights obtained from the fragility and risk assessments reveal that neglecting the multi-hazard nature of storms, as existing studies have done, can lead to a significant underestimation of vulnerability and risks. This paper also highlights how using surrogate model techniques can facilitate and reduce the computational complexity of fragility and risk assessments, particularly in multi-hazard settings.},

  abstract = {Hydrologic flood prediction has been a quite complex and difficult task because of various sources of inherent uncertainty. Accurately quantifying these uncertainties plays a significant role in providing flood warnings and mitigating risk, but it is time-consuming. To offset the cost of quantifying the uncertainty, we adopted a highly efficient metamodel based on polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) theory and applied it to a lumped, deterministic rainfallârunoff model (Nedb{\o}râAfstr{\o}mnings model, NAM) combined with generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE). The central conclusions are: (1) the subjective aspects of GLUE (e.g., the cutoff threshold values of likelihood function) are investigated for 8 flood events that occurred in the Thu bon river watershed in Vietnam, resulting that the values of 0.82 for NashâSutcliffe efficiency, 4.05\% for peak error, and 4.35\% for volume error are determined as the acceptance thresholds. Moreover, the number of ensemble behavioral sets required to maintain the sufficient range of uncertainty but to avoid any unnecessary computation was set to 500. (2) The number of experiment designs (N) and degree of polynomial (p) are key factors in estimating PCE coefficients, and values of Nâ=â50 and pâ=â4 are preferred. (3) The results computed using a PCE model consisting of polynomial bases are as good as those given by the NAM, while the total times required for making an ensemble in the PCE model are approximately seventeen times faster. (4) Two parameters (âCQOFâ and âCK12â) turned out to be most dominant based on a visual inspection of the posterior distribution and the mathematical computations of the Sobolâ and Morris sensitivity analysis. Identification of the posterior parameter distributions from the calibration process helps to find the behavioral sets even faster. The unified framework that presents the most efficient ways of predicting flow regime and quantifying the uncertainty without deteriorating accuracy will ultimately be helpful for providing warnings and mitigating flood risk in a timely manner.},

The reason for this systematic view of this scientific field is the need of computational concepts, numerical methods and computer-aided tools which can be applied to different use cases in industry. The multi-scale framework developed in this work encompasses four levels of application: (I) A server based property prediction software prototype which quantifies the uncertainty of group contribution methods and quantitative structure property relationship models and provides the confidence bounds of the estimates. (II) A modelling development level which allows the user to develop models

To our knowledge, no studies are available on this subject, and this paper provides a first insight into the value and reliability level of these assessment methods. The exploration is illustrated through three reinforced concrete structural members: a continuous girder, a continuous deep beam, and a highâstrength deep beam. The analysis is performed gradually: step by step advancing the approximation level of the mechanical and the probabilistic models. The added value of the reliabilityâbased NLFEA over the semiâprobabilistic Eurocode (EC) method is found to be on average 0.60. In other words: even if according to the semiâprobabilistic EC method the design action (Ed) is 60\% higher than the design resistance (Rd), the compliance with the target reliability criterion can be demonstrated by a reliabilityâbased NLFEA. Furthermore, it is observed that the gain and its cause (i.e., more advanced mechanical or probabilistic models) are different for the three cases. Though this outcome is restricted to the analyzed cases and should be interpreted as an upper limit added value, it indicates that a more detailed physical representation of the problem and an explicit treatment of uncertainties may uncover substantial reserves compared with the currently available, standardized assessment methods. Hence, the reliabilityâbased NLFEA method offers a promising alternative in the assessment of existing structures, enabling to avoid expensive measures that might be needed based on simplified methods.},

  abstract = {Earth system models (ESMs) consist of parameterization schemes based on oneâs perception of how the Earth system functions. A typical ESM contains a large number of parameters (i.e., the constants and exponents in the parameterization schemes) whose specification can have a significant impact on an ESMâs simulation capabilities. Sensitivity analyses (SA) is an important tool for assessing how parameter specification influences model simulations. In this study, we used an Earth system model of intermediate complexity (EMIC)âLOVECLIM as an example to illustrate how SA methods can be used to identify the most sensitive parameters that control the simulations of several key global water and energy cycle variables, including global annual mean absolute surface air temperature (TG), precipitation and evaporation over the land and over the oceans (PL, PO, EL, EO), and land runoff (RL). We also demonstrate how judiciously specifying model parameters can improve the simulations of those variables. Three SA methods MARS, RF, and sparse PCE-based Sobolâ method were used to evaluate a pool of 25 adjustable parameters chosen from land, atmosphere, and ocean components of LOVECLIM and their results were intercompared to ensure robustness of the results. It is found that with different parameter specification, TG can vary from 10 to 20 oC, and the values of PL, PO, EL, and EO can change by more than 100\%. An interesting observation is that the value of RL vary from 13,000 to 35,000 km3, far below the observed climatological value of 40,000 km3, indicating a model structural deficiency in representing land runoff by LOVECLIM which must be corrected to obtain more reasonable global water budgets. We also note that parameter sensitivities are significantly different at different latitudes. Finally, we showed that global water and energy cycle simulations can be significantly improved by even a crude automatic parameter tuning, indicating that parameter optimization can be a viable way to improve ESM climate simulations. The results from this study should help us to understand the parameter uncertainty of a full-scale ESM.},

Atmospheric chemistry transport models (ACTMs) are widely used to provide scientific support for policy development in relation to the mitigation of the detrimental effects of air pollution on human health and ecosystems. Hence it is important to assess the level of uncertainty associated with model predictions. In this work, the application of global sensitivity analysis and uncertainty assessment methods is investigated for two ACTMs of different complexity: the Fine Resolution Atmospheric Multi-pollutant Exchange (FRAME) model and the UK regional application of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP4UK) model. For both models, the uncertainties in the outputs resulting from uncertainties in the model input emissions are quantified and apportioned. Additionally, the overall model response to variations in the input emissions within a Â± 40 \% range from the baseline is investigated as this range of variation is typically used for future scenario simulations. FRAME is a Lagrangian ACTM with 5 km x 5 km horizontal resolution over the UK domain that is used to estimate annual average concentrations and deposition of sulphur and nitrogen species. In the model, air columns with 33 vertical layers of varying thickness (from 1 m at the surface to 100 m at the top of the mixing layer) move from the boundary of the domain along straight-line trajectories with different starting angles at a 1o resolution. The model utilises annually averaged meteorology to define the column trajectories and rainfall. The chemical scheme includes gaseous-and aqueous-phase reactions. FRAME supplies Source-Receptor Relationship (SRR) matrices for the UK Integrated Assessment Model, which directly underpins UK air pollution control policies. EMEP4UK is a 3-D Eulerian model with a horizontal resolution of 5 km Ã 5 km over the British Isles and 20 vertical levels, extending from the ground to 100 hPa, which is also extensively used to inform UK air quality assessment. The chemical scheme implemented in the model is EmChem09 with the MARS equilibrium module for gas-aerosol partitioning of secondary inorganic aerosol. In addition to the pollutants modelled by FRAME, EMEP4UK is capable of modelling ozone (O3) and speciated particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) concentrations, all at hourly temporal resolutions. In this study, the uncertainty ranges for the input emissions from UK anthropogenic land-based sources were assigned according to the data provided by the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory. For the FRAME model, the uncertainties in the outputs were propagated from the uncertainties in the emissions of SO2, NOx, and NH3. For the EMEP4UK model, an increased number of input variables was used; the emissions of NOx, SO2, NH3, VOC, and primary PM2.5 were split into 13 model inputs based on the contributions from different emission source sectors. The optimised Latin hypercube sampling design was used for both models to construct model runs that covered a chosen range of input emission perturbations. The FRAME model was investigated using several regression techniques. The response of the model to emission perturbations within a \pm 40\% range from the baseline value was found to be substantially linear. Surface concentrations of SO2, NOx, and NH3 together with the deposition of S and N were found to be predominantly sensitive to the emissions of the respective pollutant, while sensitivities of secondary species such as HNO3 and particulate SO42â, NO3â, and NH4+ to pollutant emissions were more complex and geographically variable. Additionally, the uncertainty in the surface concentrations of NH3 and NOx and the depositions of NHx and NOy was shown to be due to uncertainty in a single input variable, NH3, and NOx respectively. In contrast, the uncertainty in concentration and deposition of sulfur containing species were affected by the uncertainties in both NH3 and SO2 emissions. Similarly, the relative uncertainties in the modelled surface concentrations of each of the secondary pollutant variables were affected by the uncertainty range of at least two input variables. An emulator-based approach was used to propagate and apportion uncertainty in EMEP4UK outputs and investigate the model response to input perturbations. A separate Gaussian process emulator was used to estimate model predictions at unsampled points in the space of the uncertain model inputs for every modelled grid cell. For the surface concentrations of O3, NO2, and PM2.5 (pollutants associated with the adverse effects on human health) the highest level of uncertainty was found to occur in the grid cells comprising urban areas, up to \pm7\%, \pm9\%, and \pm9\% respectively. However, overall uncertainty calculated for the land-based grid cells for the variables above was found to be low, which indicates that the outputs may be more sensitive to variation in other model input parameters, such as chemical or physical constants. Alternatively, UK land-based concentrations of O3, NO2, and PM2.5 may be dominated by the precursor emissions and long-range transport of pollutants from outside the UK. Investigating seasonal changes in uncertainty and sensitivity for the monthly-averaged model outputs allowed determination of the importance of the inputs that drive uncertainty changes throughout the year. For example, uncertainty in O3 was driven more by uncertainty in VOC emissions during the summer, and for PM2.5 the importance of NH3 in driving overall uncertainty increased during spring and summer. The aim of the global methods for sensitivity analysis and uncertainty assessment presented here is to quantify the confidence in model predictions associated with particular aspects of model operation. Furthermore, the model runs and emulators created for the analyses can be used to predict the ACTM response for any other combination of perturbed input emissions within the ranges set for the original Latin hypercube sampling design without the need to re-run the ACTM. This makes exploring different emission perturbation scenarios possible at a significantly reduced computational cost. The methods discussed in this study can be applied to any operational aspect of any ACTM.},

  abstract = {In the paper, we present a novel PCE-based approach for the effective analysis of worst-case scenario in a wireless telecommunication system. Usually, in such analysis derivation of polynomialchaos expansion (PCE meta-model) of a considered EM field function for one precise set of probabilitydensities of random variables does not provide enough information.  Consequently, a number of PCEmeta-models of the EM field function should be derived, each for the different joint probability density ofa vector of random variables, e.g., associated with different mean (nominal) values of random variables.The general polynomial chaos (gPC) approach requires numerical calculations for each PCE meta-modelderivation. In order to significantly decrease the time required to derive all of the PCE meta-models, thenovel approach has been introduced. It utilizes the novel so-called primary approximation and the novelanalytical formulas. They significantly decrease the number of numerical calculations required to deriveall of the PCE meta-models compared with the gPC approach. In the paper, we analyze the stochasticEM fields distributions in a telecommunication system in a spatial domain. For this purpose, analysis ofuncertainties associated with a propagation channel as well as with transmitting and receiving antennaswas introduced. We take advantage of a ray theory in our analysis. This allows us to provide the novelmethod for rapid calculation of a PCE meta-model of a telecommunication system transfer function byusing the separate PCE meta-models associated with antennas and a propagation channel.},

An iterative algorithm is also proposed for updating the response surface dynamically by adding the new training point nearest to the limit state surface to the initial training database at each step. The proposed Gaussian process response surface method is used to analyze three different case studies to assess its validity and efficiency. Direct Monte Carlo simulation is also carried out in each case to serve as the benchmark. Comparing with other methods confirms the accuracy and efficiency of the novel intelligent response surface method, which requires fewer performance function calls and avoids the need to normalize the correlative nonânormal variables.},

Accurate assessment of the relevance of different parameters can facilitate efficient modeling, online monitoring and control design of the microgrids. In this paper, a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) framework is proposed to identify the most relevant parameters that affect the small-signal stability of converter-based microgrids. First, the systematic approach to derive the complete small-signal state-space model of the microgrid is introduced and the stability index is defined. Then, the system operating states, the control and the network parameters are chosen as input variables, and the priority ranking procedure based on GSA is explained. Next, the Levenberg-Marquardt based power flow calculation is adopted to determine the steady-state operation point. The polynomial chaos expansion and the low-rank approximation methods are introduced into the GSA to further improve computation efficiency. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to an exemplary microgrid. The critical parameters influencing the system small-signal stability are identified, and the results are compared with those of the conventional local sensitivity analysis. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed methodology are verified by real-time simulation results.},

In this paper, a probabilistic power flow (PPF) analysis method is proposed to evaluate the influence of uncertainties on the power flow of MGs. First, the MG PPF model is established considering different operation modes of MGs and uncertainties of RDG and load demands. Then, the Borgonovo method, which is a density-based global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method, is used to evaluate the importance of input variables in PPF calculation. To improve the computational efficiency of GSA, the sparse polynomial chaos expansion (SPCE) is used to establish the surrogate model of MG PPF, and the Borgonovo index is calculated based on the surrogate model. Finally, the procedure of applying GSA to MG power flow is established. The proposed method is tested using 33-node and 123-node MGs, and is compared with other methods to validate its effectiveness. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method identifies critical uncertainties that affect MG power flow. Based on the rankings of input variables, the influences of critical uncertainties are diminished with energy storage systems.},

  abstract = {The robust optimization of groundwater quality monitoring network is subject to many conflicting objectives and high level of uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity. This study develops a two-stage stochastic optimization framework including the uncertainty quantification using a cheap-to-evaluate surrogate model and an improved epsilon multi-objective noisy memetic algorithm (\epsilon-MONMA) for monitoring network design. The surrogate model based on sparse polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is constructed to replace expensive simulation model in the uncertainty quantification of concentrations at the pre-defined monitoring locations for reducing huge computational cost. Additionally, the scenario discovery strategy using sparse PCE model is applied to filter a typical scenario set and the centroid of contaminant plume is used as the diversity metric, which avoids enumerating all possible contamination plumes caused by the uncertain K-field in the optimization. The proposed algorithm is then employed to solve stochastic management model to achieve robust monitoring design, indicating the insensitivity of monitoring design to plume uncertainty no matter which of the many possible scenarios becomes the true distribution of contamination under the true K-field. A synthetic aquifer considering uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity is designed to optimize monitoring network design. The Pareto-optimal solutions to the synthetic example are achieved under three of plume scenario sets defined at deterministic scenario (Scenario A0), Monte Carlo based scenario discovery (Scenario A1) and surrogate assisted scenario discovery (Scenario A2), respectively. Comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the monitoring design based on Scenario A2 outperforms either of the two designs based on Scenarios A0 and A1 in terms of the improvement of robustness of designs evaluated against the typical scenario set. Meanwhile, the performance of monitoring network deteriorates as the uncertainty of plume (noisy strength) increases, indicating the significance of reducing parameter uncertainty in groundwater monitoring design. The research findings show that the developed stochastic optimization framework is a computationally efficient and promising tool for multi-objective design of groundwater monitoring network under uncertainty.},

Deep learning gained additional interest in today's applications due to its capability to handle complex and high dimensional problems. In this study, multi-layer GMDH networks are used to perform uncertainty quantification (UQ) and sensitivity analysis (SA) of nuclear reactor simulations. GMDH is utilized as a surrogate/metamodel to replace high fidelity computer models with cheap-to-evaluate surrogate models, which facilitate UQ and SA tasks (e.g. variance decomposition, uncertainty propagation, etc.). GMDH performance is validated through two UQ applications in reactor simulations: (1) low dimensional input space (two-phase flow in a reactor channel), and (2) high dimensional space (8-group homogenized cross-sections). In both applications, GMDH networks show very good performance with small mean absolute and squared errors as well as high accuracy in capturing the target variance. GMDH is utilized afterward to perform UQ tasks such as variance decomposition through Sobol indices, and GMDH-based uncertainty propagation with large number of samples. GMDH performance is also compared to other surrogates including Gaussian processes and polynomial chaos expansions. The comparison shows that GMDH has competitive performance with the other methods for the low dimensional problem, and reliable performance for the high dimensional problem.},

  abstract = {We present a novel surrogate modeling method that can be used to accelerate the solution of uncertainty quantification (UQ) problems arising in nonlinear and non-smooth models of biological systems. In particular, we focus on dynamic flux balance analysis (DFBA) models that couple intracellular fluxes, found from the solution of a constrained metabolic network model of the cellular metabolism, to the time-varying nature of the extracellular substrate and product concentrations. DFBA models are generally computationally expensive and present unique challenges to UQ, as they entail dynamic simulations with discrete events that correspond to switches in the active set of the solution of the constrained intracellular model. The proposed non-smooth polynomial chaos expansion (nsPCE) method is an extension of traditional PCE that can effectively capture singularities in the DFBA model response due to the occurrence of these discrete events. The key idea in nsPCE is to use a model of the singularity time to partition the parameter space into two elements on which the model response behaves smoothly. Separate PCE models are then fit in both elements using a basis-adaptive sparse regression approach that is known to scale well with respect to the number of uncertain parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of nsPCE on a DFBA model of an E. coli monoculture that consists of 1075 reactions and 761 metabolites. We first illustrate how traditional PCE is unable to handle problems of this level of complexity. We demonstrate that over 800-fold savings in computational cost of uncertainty propagation and Bayesian estimation of parameters in the substrate uptake kinetics can be achieved by using the nsPCE surrogates in place of the full DFBA model simulations. We then investigate the scalability of the nsPCE method by utilizing it for global sensitivity analysis and maximum a posteriori estimation in a synthetic metabolic network problem with a larger number of parameters related to both intracellular and extracellular quantities.},
